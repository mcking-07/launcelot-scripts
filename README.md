# launcelot-scripts (lazy script)
A simple bash script to be run after a fresh install of ubuntu to set it up, just the way I like it.

This script is designed to be a one-stop solution for setting up a new ubuntu system with all the necessary tools and applications. It automates the process of updating the system, installing media codecs, applications, dev-tools and removing unnecessary packages.

## Installation
To install and run this script on your system, you can use the following steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/mcking-07/launcelot-scripts
cd lazy-script
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Usage
After running the script, it will automatically update the system, remove snapd services and packages, install necessary applications, and enable gnome-extensions. The script will also install the Nord theme and cursor, as well as the FiraCode and Meslo fonts.

## Disclaimer
This script is intended for personal use and has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Use it at your own risk.
